# Meta-analysis
Script to performe a meta-analysis of gene expression using RnakProd package


The availability of large databases of genomic data allowed new strategies for the research about molecular and cellular pathogenesis of complex conditions. Publicly available datasets from gene expression studies can be compared, grouped and analyzed to gain new insights into these conditions. This repository shown script that can be used to perform meta-analysis of gene expression that compare public microarray dasets using RankProd algoritm.
